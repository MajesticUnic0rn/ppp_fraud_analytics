Intake ppp loans for EDA and potential fraud detection/anomaly

RAW dataset of all PPP loans 
https://data.sba.gov/dataset/ppp-foia


TODO:
  Anamoly detection of outlier of loan amount with oither peers in zipcode/state
  Cluster group analysis of business addresses
  
  
potential cons:
  Fraud relies primarly on fraud rings - using graphql and combine different datasets could be helpful
  Find people who cross applied for multiple loans to commit fraud 
  Race is a factor within PPP loans - will that cause an issue?
